# Publicly releasing your service
{: #public-releasing}

After you test your third-party service, you're ready to make it publicly available in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} catalog. Record a video to demonstrate that your service meets all requirements, and submit the video to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} through email. Your demo is reviewed by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} before final publish approval can be granted. Recordings are reviewed every Tuesday with a decision or feedback returned the following Thursday, so be sure to plan enough time to prepare for you go-live date.

This task assumes you're approved to deliver your service by completing the initial registration and approval in the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Onboarding Workbench. See the [getting started tutorial](/docs/sell?topic=sell-get-started#get-started).
{: tip}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin}

Ensure that you started step 1 and completed steps 2, 3, 4, and 5:
1. [Author service docs and marketing announcement](/docs/sell?topic=sell-content-tasks#content-tasks).
2. [Define your offering in the resource management console](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step2-define#step2-define).
3. [Develop and host your service brokers](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step3-osb#step3-osb).
4. [Develop an authentication flow](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step4-iam#step4-iam).
5. [Publishing and testing your service](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step5-pubtest#step5-pubtest)


## Record your demo
{: #demo}

1. Work with your IBM representative to understand the requirements and exactly what you need to demonstrate.
2. Pick the recording software of your choice (Quicktime on macOS and Windows Media Player on Windows both offer free video and audio recording options).
3. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and start recording.

## Send your demo to IBM
{: #send-demo}

Email your demo recording or recordings to servp@us.ibm.com.

Your demo is reviewed by IBM before final publish approval can be granted. Recordings are reviewed every Tuesday with a decision or feedback returned the following Thursday, so be sure to plan enough time to prepare for you go-live date. An IBM approver iterates through email until you meet all the requirements.

## After approval is granted, IBM will GA your service
{: #approval}

When IBM approves your service, you receive an email and IBM coordinates the release of your General Availability service. IBM moves your service out of limited visibility mode and makes it fully visible to your customers.
