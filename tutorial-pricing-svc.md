{: toc-completion-time="10m"} 

This tutorial walks you through the steps for adding pricing plans and features for your third-party service. By completing this tutorial, you add your Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), define your pricing plan and add a list of features for your product. 
{: shortdesc}

This tutorial is one of five in a series that demonstrates how to onboard and publish a service to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. As you complete the tutorial, adapt each step to fit your needs.

## Before you begin
{: #svc-pricing-prereqs}

1. [Register your service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Partner Center](/docs/sell?topic=sell-svc-register).
1. [Define the product details of your service](/docs/sell?topic=sell-svc-define).
1. [Onboard a broker](/docs/sell?topic=sell-broker-onboard).

## Add your ECCN
{: #svc-eccn}
{: step}

Provide your ECCN for your service. If you don't have your ECCN, use the [Commerce Control List](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/licensing/commerce-control-list-classification/export-control-classification-number-eccn){: external} to determine your ECCN. 

1. Click **Pricing** > **Enter your ECCN**.
2. Enter your ECCN. 
3. Click **Save**.

## Define your pricing plan
{: #svc-plan-details}
{: step}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} supports two pricing models: free or usage-based. For the purposes of this tutorial, complete the following steps to add a free pricing plan. 

1. Click **Pricing** > **Add Plan**.
1. Select Free.
1. Enter a name and description, and select the locations in which your pricing plan will be available to users.
1. Click **Save**. 

    When you submit a usage-based plan, an Incomplete status appears in the table. After you add your broker, you must link your pricing plan and broker.
    {: note}
    
## Add features for your service
{: #svc-add-feature}

If you completed the steps to define your pricing plan, you can add a list of features for your service. These features uniquely identify your product's attributes and differentiate your pricing plan from others. By providing a list of features for your product, you can help customers choose the most suitable pricing plan for their use case. 

You can add up to five features for your product, but you must add at least one. The first feature that you add appears more prominently. Make sure to include the most important and differentiating details as the first feature. 
{: note}
  
To add features for your service, complete the following steps:

1. Click **Pricing**.
1. Select a pricing plan from the table that you previously added. After you select a plan, you are redirected to the **Pricing plan details** page.
1. Click **Add features**.
1. Enter a description for each feature.
   - You can remove any feature that you add by clicking **Remove feature**.
1. Click **Save**.

## Next steps
{: #svc-pricing-next}

Return to the Partner Center and submit your [request to publish your service](/docs/sell?topic=sell-svc-publish) to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.
