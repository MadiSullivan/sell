This tutorial walks you through the steps for adding pricing plans for your third-party service. By completing this tutorial, you add your ECCN and define your pricing plan.
{: shortdesc}

This tutorial is one of five in a series that demonstrates how to onboard and publish a service to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. As you complete the tutorial, adapt each step to fit your needs.

## Before you begin
{: #svc-pricing-prereqs}

1. [Register your service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Partner Center](/docs/sell?topic=sell-svc-register).
1. [Define the product details of your service](/docs/sell?topic=sell-svc-define).
1. [Onboard a broker](/docs/sell?topic=sell-broker-onboard).

## Add your ECCN
{: #svc-eccn}
{: step}

Provide your Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) for your service. If you don't have your ECCN, use the [Commerce Control List](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/licensing/commerce-control-list-classification/export-control-classification-number-eccn){: external} to determine your ECCN. 

1. Click **Pricing** > **Enter your ECCN**.
2. Enter your ECCN. 
3. Click **Save**.

## Define your pricing plan
{: #svc-plan-details}
{: step}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} supports two pricing models: free or usage-based. For the purposes of this tutorial, complete the following steps to add a free pricing plan. 

1. Click **Pricing** > **Add Plan**.
1. Select Free.
1. Enter a name and description, and select the locations in which your pricing plan will be available to users.
