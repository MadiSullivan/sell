# Defining your pricing model
{: #sw-pricing}

When onboarding your product, you will need to define the pricing model for your software. Currently, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog supports free plans and bring your own license (BYOL).

The process to sell third-party products is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or deliver product for free. If you have questions, contact us at cloud.onboarding@ibm.com.
