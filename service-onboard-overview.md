# Onboarding your service
{: #overview}

The process to onboard and manage services through the resource management console is limited to existing services. New services must be onboarded through Partner Center. To onboard a new service, see [Getting set up to sell services](/docs/sell?topic=sell-get-started).
{: important}

This topic introduces you to the steps that are required to onboard and sell your third-party service in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}. 
{: shortdesc}

After you're approved to sell your product in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, you start onboarding your it in the resource management console, a guided UI experience. You design your catalog metadata, set up the service pricing plans, and integrate with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM). 

Next, outside of the resource management console, you perform code development to build and host a new open service broker. Starter broker samples and API docs are provided, and you use IAM to develop an authentication flow. After you complete these steps, you return to the resource management console to add your service to the catalog in a limited visibility mode where you can test and validate deliverable requirements. When you've met all requirements, your service becomes fully visible in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog!

Due to current processing times, service onboarding is currently limited to providers who meet the following prerequistes:

1. Providers who leverage one or more services in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog.
2. Providers who intend on selling their product in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog.

Reach out to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Business Development Executive or the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Onboarding Team](mailto:cloudonb@us.ibm.com) for more information. 

## Registering your service
{: #process}

After securing a pre-approval code from the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Onboarding Team](mailto:cloudonb@us.ibm.com), register your service in the [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Onboarding Workbench](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/workbench/qualification){: external}.

1. From the Onboarding Workbench details page, click **Onboard a new offering**, and complete the registration form.
2. Check your inbox for an email that confirms your registration.

## Listing your service type
{: #list-service}

Use the Onboarding Workbench to list your service type as an integrated billing service.

1. From the [Onboarding Workbench dashboard](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/workbench/provider/dashboard){: external}, click **Tasks** on your offering tile.
2. Select **{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} listing tasks** from the **Filter** menu to filter for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} tasks only.
3. Click **Start** in the Content task tile, and complete the readiness assessment form. Answer the last question by selecting **Integrated billing service** as the offering type.

## Defining your service details
{: #define-details}

After you select **Integrated billing service** as your service type and submit the readiness assessment form, the page is refreshed with a section for defining the content. It's displayed on your catalog details page in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. Complete each field and submit the form for review. The review process can take a few days.

When you're approved, you receive an email that outlines your next steps:

* In the Onboarding Workbench, you create your getting started documentation and marketing content.

    The email includes the link to where your getting started documentation is published. Save the URL, because you use it as you're working in the resource management console.
    {: tip}

* In the resource management console, add your service to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} by defining your service, building pricing plans, enabling security, and managing the deployment of your service in different {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environments. 

### Support
{: #support}

### Continuous updates
{: #maintain}

After your service is live in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, you can continue to iterate and make updates by working directly with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} representative.
