# Defining your pricing model for services
{: #service-pricing-info}

When you onboard your service to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you must define a pricing plan. If you have detailed knowledge about how you want to charge users for your service, you can provide that information in your plan. However, you can start by enabling a free plan, and then set up a paid plan later if your needs change. Currently, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} supports free and usage-based pricing plans.

### Confirming the digital platform reseller agreement
{: #service-confirm-dra}

If you plan to offer usage-based pricing plans, it is required to sign the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Digital Platform Reseller Agreement. This legal agreement sets the terms and conditions under which providers can onboard and sell products in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Or, you can upload a custom digital provider agreement in `.pdf`, `.doc`, or `.docx` file format. 

Custom digital provider agreements must be reviewed and approved by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, which increases the time it takes for you to complete the onboarding process. The uploaded files are scanned for viruses, which might take a few minutes to complete. If a virus is detected, it is recommended to run another virus scan on your file, and then try uploading it again.

## Adding features for your service
{: #service-add-feature}

If you completed the steps to define your pricing plan, you can add a list of features for your service. These features uniquely identify your product's attributes and differentiate your pricing plan from others. By providing a list of features for your product, you can help customers choose the most suitable pricing plan for their use case. 

You can add up to five features for your product, but you must add at least one. The first feature that you add appears more prominently. Include the most important and differentiating details as the first feature.
