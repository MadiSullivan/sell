# Defining your pricing plan
{: #service-pricing-info}

When you onboard your service to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you must define a pricing plan. If you have detailed knowledge about how you want to charge users for your service, you can provide that information in your plan. However, you can start by enabling a free plan, and then set up a paid plan later if your needs change. Currently, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} supports free and paid usage-based pricing plans. 
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-pricing}

Before you submit a pricing plan for approval, you must sign the required agreements, documentation, and provide the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) and United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC) that applies to your product. The prerequisites might differ depending on whether you have a free or usage-based pricing plan.

For free plans:

* Provide the ECCN that applies to your product.
* Provide the UNSPSC that applies to your product.
* Confirm the digital platform agreement.

For paid, usage-based plans:

* Provide the ECCN that applies to your product.
* Provide the UNSPSC that applies to your product.
* Submit your tax and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) information for paid plans to set up and receive payments for usage. 
* Confirm the digital platform reseller agreement.

Depending on the type of plan you're adding, complete each prerequisite by using the following instructions.

### Submitting tax and EFT forms
{: #submit-tax-eft}

For services that you offer on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} with a paid, usage-based pricing plan, you receive payments based on the usage in accordance with your pricing structure. To receive payments, you must complete and submit the EFT form and tax documentation. 

To provide tax and EFT information, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center** > **Sell** > **My payments**.
1. Download the relevant EFT form, and complete it.

    A scanned copy of a voided check is required when you submit this form.
    {: important}

1. Download the relevant tax documentation, and complete it.
1. Submit the completed documentation by email to `apremit@us.ibm.com`. You must include `cloud.onboarding@ibm.com` on the email.
1. Select **I confirm that I completed and emailed all of the required documents.**. 

### Providing the ECCN
{: #service-eccn}

To start defining your pricing model, you must provide the ECCN that applies to your product. The ECCN is required for both free and usage-based pricing plans. If you don't have your ECCN, you can find it on the [Commerce Control List](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/licensing/commerce-control-list-classification/export-control-classification-number-eccn){: external}. If you need to update your ECCN after you add it, you must contact {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support. 

You must submit your tax and EFT documents and receive approval before you can provide the ECCN if you're using a usage-based pricing plan.
{: note}

1. Go to **Partner Center** > **Sell** > **My products**.
1. Open the service that you want to edit and go to the **Pricing** tab.

### Accepting agreement terms and conditions
{: #service-confirm-dra}

Custom digital provider agreements must be reviewed and approved by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, which increases the time it takes for you to complete the onboarding process. The uploaded files are scanned for viruses, which might take a few minutes to complete. If a virus is detected, it is recommended to run another virus scan on your file, and then try uploading it again.
