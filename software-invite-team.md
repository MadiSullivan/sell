# Inviting team members to help onboard software
{: #sw-invite-team}

If you want to enlist team members to help onboard your third-party software to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, you can invite them to your account. By inviting team members to your account, they are automatically assigned the required access to complete the onboarding tasks. 
{: shortdesc}

When you invite team members to your account, they are assigned editor access to the following services by default:

* Product lifecycle: Editors can complete onboarding tasks, update the visibility of products at the account level, and request approval to publish products to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. 
* Catalog management: Editors can onboard products to private catalogs, update the visibility of products at the account and private catalog levels, and restrict the visibility of products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.

Complete the following steps to invite team members to your account: 

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center** > **Sell** > **My Team**.
1. Click **Invite users**.
1. Enter the email address of each user.  
1. Click **Invite**.

For more information about the roles and actions for each service, see [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/sell?topic=account-account-services#account-management-actions-roles).
