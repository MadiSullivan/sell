# Inviting team members to help onboard software
{: #sw-invite-team}

If you want to enlist team members to help onboard your third-party software to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, you can invite them to your account. By inviting team members to your account, they are automatically assigned the required access to complete the onboarding tasks. 
{: shortdesc}

The process to sell third-party software is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or deliver your third-party software for free. If you have questions, contact us at cloud.onboarding@us.ibm.com.

When you invite team members to your account, they are assigned editor access to the following services by default:

* Product lifecycle: Editors can complete onboarding tasks, update the visibility of products at the account level, and request approval to publish products to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. 
* Catalog management: Editors can onboard products to private catalogs, update the visibility of products at the account and private catalog levels, and restrict the visiblity of products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.

Complete the following steps to invite team members to your account: 

1. Go to the [Partner Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/partner-center/sell){: external} in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, and click **My Team**.
1. Click **Invite users**.
1. Enter the email address of each user.
