# Deploying a Helm chart to a new target
{: #helm-target-new}

To deploy a version of a Helm chart to another deployment target, you can copy the configuration of the existing version and deploy it to a new target. The deployment target options for Helm charts are {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}}.
