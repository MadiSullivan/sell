# Creating your documentation and marketing announcement
{: #content-tasks}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} Onboarding Workbench to create your getting started documentation and marketing announcement.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #marketing-prereqs}

Make sure that you completed the [getting started tutorial](/docs/sell?topic=sell-get-started#get-started), and you're approved to deliver your third-party service.

## Create your getting started documentation
{: #gs-docs}

To deliver your service, you're required to provide getting started documentation that describes how users get started with using your service in the context of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}. You can work on this task in parallel while you develop your service.

1. Log in to the [Onboarding Workbench](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/workbench/qualification){: external}.
2. From the dashboard, click **Tasks** on your offering tile.
3. Filter for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} listing tasks, and click **Start** in the Guidance task tile.
4. Follow the Guidance task workflow to publish your getting started documentation in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} doc app.

Your catalog metadata must link to your published documentation URL. Defining your offering in the resource management console includes adding your URL value to the `documentationURL` metadata and `instructionsURL` field in the **Offering** tab.

## Create your service announcement
{: #announcement}

In addition to your getting started documentation, you're also required to create marketing content to announce the availability of your service through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} newsletter and social media channels. You can work on this task in parallel while you develop your service.

1. Log in to the [Onboarding Workbench](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/workbench/qualification){: external}.
2. From the dashboard, click **Tasks** on your offering tile.
3. Filter for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} listing tasks, and click **Start** in the Marketing task tile.
4. Follow the Marketing task workflow to create and submit your service announcement.

After you submit your service announcement, an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} marketing manager reviews and approves it, and then publishes it to the appropriate channels after your service is released.

## Next steps
{: #next-steps}

Now that you've started the tasks for creating your getting started documentation and service announcement, you're ready to define your offering in the resource management console. See [Defining your offering in the resource management console](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step2-define#step2-define).
