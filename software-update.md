# Updating your software
{: #3p-update-software-version}

After you onboard your third-party software, you can update the version that's used. If a version is updated or added, you must update the deployment values to make sure that any recent changes are included.  
{: shortdesc}

Deployment values must be updated when a version is updated. The following procedure helps you import the changes that you made to your software in your repo: 

1. Go to the repo of your software. 
1. Click **Releases**, select the release that you want to update to, and copy the link address. 
1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Catalogs**. 
1. Select your private catalog and select your product.  
1. Click **Import version**.  
1. Enter the URL for your updated `.tgz` URL and click **Refresh version**. 
1. ClickÂ **Update** to save your changes.

If you want to edit or update your product, see [Validating your software](/docs/sell?topic=sell-sw-validate).
