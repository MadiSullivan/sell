## Developing your service
{: #develop}

| Task | Subtasks | Description | Environment |
|------| ----------| ------------|-----|
| Learn about the Open Service Broker specification version 2.12. | ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I read through the Open Service Broker specification and I understand that I must develop my own Open Service Broker. |  Service brokers manage the lifecycle of services. The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform interacts with Open Service Brokers to create and manage service instances and service bindings. For more information, see [Developing and hosting your service brokers](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step3-osb#step3-osb). | Documentation |
| View the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} broker samples. | ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I cloned the repo, browsed the broker samples, and I'm ready to use these samples to start development. |  [https://github.com/IBM/sample-resource-service-brokers](https://github.com/IBM/sample-resource-service-brokers){: external} | Code examples |
| View the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Open Service Broker API documentation. | ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I understand the several required endpoints that the code in my Open Service Broker must support.  \n  \n  ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I understand that if my service can be bound to apps in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, it must return API endpoints and credentials to my service users.  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I understand that {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} has defined extended API endpoints that allow service instances to be disabled and reenabled. |  The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Open Service Broker extends the Open Service Broker 2.12 specification. Learn about the [required endpoints](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step3-osb#endpoint-sb) your service broker must use. | Documentation |
| Use your catalog metadata to start developing your service broker. | ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I understand that some of the metadata I provided in the resource management console must be exported and provided in my Open Service Broker.   \n  \n  ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I added the required GUIDs, and other required values listed in my `catalog.json` file, to the services array in my sample Open Service Broker. | After you download a `catalog.json` file from the resource management console, you can use it to inform the development of your Open Service Broker. For more information, see [the steps to use exported metadata to guide development](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step3-osb#use-metadata). | Development environment and documentation |
| Host your Open Service Broker. | ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I understand that the hosted location of my service broker must follow Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2. | Your service broker must be hosted as part of an app that can respond to REST API calls. And your hosted location must meet {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} security guidelines. For more information, see [the steps to host your service broker](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step3-osb#host). | Development environment and documentation |
| Test your hosted Open Service Broker. | ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I validated each of the API endpoints my service broker supports by running curl commands against my hosted service broker. | Validate your service broker by running curl commands against the different endpoints you’re enabling. For more information, see [the steps to test your service broker](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step3-osb#broker-test).| Development environment and documentation |
| Derive and set your IAM redirect URI. | ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I successfully derived my IAM redirect URI by using the hosted location of my Open Service Broker and some authentication information.  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I successfully completed the Access Management page by specifying my redirect URI and correctly setting my client ID. | When you define your service in resource management console, you generate a client ID, but note that you likely didn’t have a redirect URI at the time. The client ID is set to `false`. Until you return to the resource management console with your redirect URI, you won't have a true Client ID. For more information, see [the steps to derive your redirect URI](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step4-iam). | Development environment and the resource management console |
| Develop your Open Authorization (OAuth) flow for authentication. | ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I understand that IAM supports Open ID Connect (OIDC).  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I found my IAM regional endpoint and I successfully redirect users from `dashboard_url` to my assembled redirect URI, and I store the user's `access_token` returned in my response so it can be used during authentication. | Users that visit your service dashboard must be correctly authenticated. Develop OAuth token-based authentication and authorization by using IAM. For more information, see [the steps to develop your OAuth flow](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step4-iam). | Development environment and documentation|
| Validate user authorization. | ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I can get an access token for an API key.  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I can validate authorization for users to the service instance. | After developing your OAuth flow for authentication, you must validate that users are correctly authorized, ensuring that users of your service can access your service dashboard. For more information, see [the steps to validate](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step4-iam#validate). | Development environment and documentation |

## Publishing and testing your service
{: #pubtest}

| Task | Subtasks | Description | Environment |
|------| ----------| ------------|-----|
| Publish your service in limited visibility mode. | ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I successfully registered my hosted Open Service Broker on the Deployments page in the resource management console.  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I successfully created new deployments, and published my offering to one or more regions. |  Now that your hosted service brokers meet the Open Service Broker specification, you can publish your service to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog. For more information, see [the steps to publish your service](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step5-pubtest). | Resource management console |
| Test your offering. | ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I can see my service in the catalog.  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I validated authentication from the service instance dashboard.  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I validated that my service is displayed correctly in the catalog.  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I can select a plan and create a service instance.  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I can delete a service instance.  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I can connect my service to another application.  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I can disconnect my service and delete the connection.  \n  \n  ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I can generate a service key and delete that service key.  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") I worked with my IBM representative to validate that my offering correctly supports the enable and disable endpoints.  \n  \n ![Checkbox icon](../icons/checkbox-icon.svg "Checkbox") Because my offering has a metered plan, I successfully tested usage submission. | Now that your hosted service brokers meet the Open Service Broker specification, you can publish your service to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog. For more information, see [the steps to test your service](/docs/sell?topic=sell-step5-pubtest). | {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console |
