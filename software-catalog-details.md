### Selecting your provider type

* Third-party products are provided by individual software entities, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Business Partners, or independent software vendors (ISV).

* Community products are provided by open source communities. If a root cause analysis determines that a support issue is a defect in an open source or community product, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} isn't required to provide a fix. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} closes the case and refers users to the community or forum for assistance.
