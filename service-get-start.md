# Getting set up to sell services
{: #get-started}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"} 
{: toc-completion-time="60m"} 

Welcome to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}! To start onboarding your service to our cloud platform, first complete a few tasks: provide your company and product details, create a test environment, and set up access for your team to help with the onboarding process.
{: shortdesc}

It's recommended that you use an account that was created with a [functional ID](/docs/account?topic=account-identity-overview#functionalid-bestpract) to ensure your continued access to the products that are onboarded in the account.
{: tip}

## Before you begin
{: #prereq}

Due to current processing times, service onboarding is limited to providers who meet the following prerequisites:

1. Providers who leverage one or more services in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog.
2. Providers who intend on selling their product in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog.

Reach out to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Business Development Executive or submit a [Service Onboarding Request](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/us-en/resources/campaignmail/mail/us-en/xaas_products_onboarding/){: external} to our {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} onboarding team. 

## Provide your company name
{: #step1-register}
{: step}

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center** > **Sell** > **Get started**.
2. Enter the name of your company as you want it to be displayed in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.  

    The company name doesn't need to be finalized. You can update it later from the My company page in Partner Center if necessary.
    {: tip}

## Create a test environment
{: #step2-testenv}
{: step}

A test environment is not needed for onboarding services but is needed for any software that you might onboard in the future. You, or a member of your team, uses the test environment to validate that your software is ready for use.

1. Click **Create** in the "Create your test environment" section on the Get started page.
2. Enter the name of your private catalog, and click **Create**. The private catalog and its contents are visible only to the users you choose.

## Set up team access
{: #step3-team-access}
{: step}

If you want to enlist team members to help with the onboarding process, you need to assign them specific levels of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) access. To streamline the process, you can organize your team members into a single entity by adding them to an access group. 

1. Click **Assign** in the "Assign access" section on the Get started page.
2. Enter the name of the access group, and click **Assign**. Members of this group are assigned the following roles by default:

    * Administrator on the catalog management service
    * Editor on the Partner Center - Sell service
    * Editor on the user management service
    * Editor on the IAM access groups service
    * Viewer on all account management services
  
    For more information about the actions associated with each role, see [Actions and roles for account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#account-management-actions-roles).

3. Click **Let's go**. 

## Next steps
{: #gs-next-steps}

Now that you completed the getting started tasks, you're ready to [define the product details of your service](/docs/sell?topic=sell-svc-define). 

To get an overview of all the tasks involved in the process, see [Checklist for selling service on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/sell?topic=sell-checklist).
