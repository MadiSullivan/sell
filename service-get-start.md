# Getting set up to sell services
{: #get-started}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"} 
{: toc-completion-time="45m"} 

In this tutorial, we walk you through the process to sell your third-party service on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. Your service is offered as an integrated billing service, which means users can create an instance of your service automatically, and they can select from different pricing plans. Users receive a single bill for both their {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} product and your third-party service.

## Before you begin
{: #prereq}

Due to current processing times, service onboarding is currently limited to providers who meet the following prerequistes:

1. Providers who leverage one or more services in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog.
2. Providers who intend on selling their product in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog.

Reach out to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Business Development Executive or [Cloud Onboarding Team](mailto:cloudonb@us.ibm.com) for more information.

## Register your service
{: #step1-register}
{: step}

Register your service in the [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Onboarding Workbench](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/workbench/qualification){: external}.

1. After securing a pre-approval code from the [Cloud Onboarding Team](mailto:cloudonb@us.ibm.com)
2. From the Provider workbench details page, click **Onboard a new offering**, and complete the registration form.
3. Check your inbox for an email that confirms your registration.

## List your service type
{: #step2-list}
{: step}

Use the Onboarding Workbench to list your service type as an integrated billing service.

1. From the [Onboarding Workbench dashboard](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/workbench/provider/dashboard){: external}, click **Tasks** on your product tile.
2. Select **{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} listing tasks** from the **Filter** menu to filter for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} tasks only.
3. Click **Start** in the Content task tile, and complete the readiness assessment form. Answer the last question by selecting **Integrated billing service** as the service type.

## Define your service details
{: #step3-define}
{: step}

After you select **Integrated billing service** as your service type and submit the readiness assessment form, the page is refreshed with a section for defining the content. It's displayed on your catalog details page in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. Complete each field and submit the form for review. 

## Next steps
{: #gs-next-steps}

When you're approved, you receive an email that outlines your next steps:

* In the Onboarding Workbench, you create your getting started documentation and marketing content.

    The email includes the link to where your getting started documentation is published. Save the URL, because you use it as you're working in the resource management console.
    {: tip}

* In the resource management console, onboard your service to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} by defining your service, building pricing plans, enabling security, and managing the deployment of your service in different {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environments.
