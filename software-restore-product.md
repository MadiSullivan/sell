# Restoring deprecated products or versions
{: #restore-deprecated-product}

After you deprecate your product or version, your software enters a 90-day deprecation period before it is removed from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog. During this deprecation period, you can restore your software to its last published state to keep it in the catalog. Your software cannot be restored after the 90-day deprecation period.

The process to sell third-party products is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or deliver your product for free. If you have questions, contact us at cloud.onboarding@ibm.com.
