The following table provides a detailed comparison of the service types that you can sell.

|----------------|----------------------------|------------------|

You develop an Open Service Broker, test it, and add your service through a series of self-service steps. | Onboarding is handled through the Onboarding Workbench. The self-service onboarding process takes about two weeks. | 
| **Deploying**  | Created by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform | API-based services only | 
| **Billing**    |  In the integrated billing model, the user receives a single bill for both their {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} product and their integrated third-party service. | In the referral model, you bill the user and keep 100% of the revenue.  |
