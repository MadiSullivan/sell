# Service types
{: #service-types}

You can sell your service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} as an integrated billing service or a referral service. With the integrated billing service option, users can create an instance of your service automatically, and they can select from different pricing plans. With the referral service option, users are directed to your website from your service's catalog details page in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to create an account and get the required credentials to connect your service to an app in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

The following table provides a detailed comparison of the service types that you can sell.

|                | Integrated billing service | Referral service | 
|----------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| **Onboarding** | Onboarding is handled through the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Provider Workbench and the resource management console. You develop an Open Service Broker, test it, and add your service through a series of self-service steps. | Onboarding is handled through the Provider Workbench. The self-service onboarding process takes about two weeks. | 
| **Deploying**  | Created by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform | API-based services only | 
| **Billing**    |  In the integrated billing model, the user receives a single bill for both their {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} product and their integrated third-party service. | In the referral model, you bill the user and keep 100% of the revenue.  |
