# Why can't I validate or publish my software?
{: #tgz-import-error}
{: troubleshoot}

If the files in your source repository were changed after you imported your software, you might not be able to validate your product or access it in your private catalog.
{: shortdesc}

You imported your software package as a `.tgz` file from the Software tab in Partner Center, but you can't validate it. In your Schematics logs, the following message is displayed:
{: tsSymptoms}

> Error: Failed SHA validation, reload version to update the Digest

When you access your product in the private catalog, the following message is also displayed:

> Package required: We couldn't find the URL for your package. Verify that the package exists and that the access secret is valid.

These errors typically occur because the contents of your software package were changed after you imported the package.
{: tsCauses}

Reset the software package by reloading the version of your software that you're trying to onboard. For more information, see [Reloading a software version](/docs/sell?topic=sell-software-reload).
{: tsResolve}
