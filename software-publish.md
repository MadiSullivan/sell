# Publishing your software to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog
{: #sw-publish}

As the last step in the onboarding process, you can submit a request to publish your third-party software to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog. When you publish to the catalog, your software is publicly available for all users.

The process to sell third-party software is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or deliver your third-party software for free. If you have questions, contact us at kdmeyer@ibm.com.
