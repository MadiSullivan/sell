# Suspending your product from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog
{: #suspend-product}

If you need to remove a product from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog, you can suspend it for a short time without permanently deleting or deprecating it. Suspending a product can be useful if, for example, you discover a bug or a vulnerability in your product that must be investigated before more customers install it.

The process to sell third-party software is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or deliver your third-party software for free. If you have questions, contact us at cloud.onboarding@us.ibm.com.
