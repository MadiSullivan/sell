# Suspending your product from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog
{: #suspend-product}

If you need to remove a product from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog without permanently deleting or deprecating it, you can suspend it for up to 7 days. Suspending a product can be useful if, for example, you discover a bug or a vulnerability in your product that must be investigated before more customers install it.
