# Suspending your product from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog
{: #suspend-product}

If you need to remove a product from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog, you can suspend it for a short time without permanently deleting it. Suspending a product can be useful if, for example, you discover a bug or a vulnerability in your product that must be investigated before more customers install it.

The process to sell third-party software is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or deliver your third-party software for free. If you have questions, contact us at kdmeyer@ibm.com.

Complete the following steps to suspend your product: 

1. Go to the [Partner Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/partner-center/sell){: external} in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, and click **My Products**.
1. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/actions-icon-vertical.svg "Actions") for the product you want to suspend, and select **Suspend**.  
1. Explain why you want to suspend your product.  
1. Click **Submit**.

After your product is suspended, you have 7 days to submit a request to publish it to the catalog again. If you don't submit a request within 7 days, your product will be deprecated.
